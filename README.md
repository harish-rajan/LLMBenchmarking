# LLM Benchmarking for Aya

## Overview
LLM Benchmarking for Aya is a high-performance C++ data pipeline designed to optimize, benchmark, and evaluate the Aya Large Language Model (LLM) for scalable multilingual benchmarking. The project ensures efficient data processing, evaluation, and validation for large-scale LLM performance assessment.

This repository contains optimized C++ code that processes large volumes of multilingual data, runs statistical analysis, and generates performance reports based on key benchmarking metrics.

## Key Features
- **High-Performance C++ Pipeline**: Optimized for speed and efficiency to process vast multilingual datasets.
- **Multilingual Benchmarking**: Supports evaluation across multiple languages, ensuring Aya performs well globally.
- **Statistical Performance Metrics**:
  - **Confusion Matrix**: Provides insight into misclassification and model errors.
  - **Per-Language Accuracy Breakdown**: Analyzes LLM performance for different languages.
  - **Difficulty Index**: Evaluates the complexity of specific datasets and model responses.
- **Scalable & Modular Design**: Built for large-scale deployment and easy integration with AI/ML pipelines.

## Technical Stack
- **Language**: C++ (with performance optimizations)
- **Libraries**:
  - `Eigen` (for matrix computations)
  - `OpenMP` (for parallel processing)
  - `Boost` (for efficient data handling)
- **Build System**: CMake
